Face Recognition Using Python and OpenCV
This project demonstrates a basic Face Recognition system implemented in Python using the OpenCV library. It showcases how to detect and recognize faces from images and real-time video feeds using Haar Cascade classifiers.

Features:
Face Detection: Uses Haar cascades to identify faces in images and video.

Face Recognition: Compares detected faces against a known dataset of images.

Real-time Video Feed: Captures frames from a webcam and performs face detection live.

Simple and Clean Implementation: Easy-to-understand Jupyter Notebook format for quick experimentation and learning.

Requirements:
Python 3.x

OpenCV (cv2)

NumPy

Getting Started:
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-recognition.git
Install dependencies:

nginx
Copy
Edit
pip install opencv-python numpy
Run the Jupyter Notebook:

nginx
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook Face_Recognition_.ipynb
Notes:
The project uses Haar cascades for face detection, which is a traditional method. You can also integrate deep learning models like DNN or pre-trained models for improved accuracy.

For best performance, ensure good lighting and a clear background while capturing video.
